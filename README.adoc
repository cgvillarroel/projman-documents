== Dependencies/Setup

An install script is provided for convenience, but you first must allow scripts:

[source,powershell]
----
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
./install
----

[NOTE]
====
The script will pause in middle after setting up MSYS2. *Enter `+exit+` to continue*
====

This will install the following:

* Scoop
** neovim
** pandoc
** pdftk
** miktex
** msys2
** ruby
* Ruby
** asciidoctor

== Building

A build script is provided for convenience:

[source,powershell]
----
./build
----

[NOTE]
====
Before trying to do your first build, you should first update MiKTeX by doing the following:

* Open the MiKTeX Console (start menu search)
* Click `+Check for updates+`
* Go to the `+Updates+` tab and click `+Update now+`

Building for the first time will prompt you to install LaTeX packages.

* *Install all of them* (you can uncheck the `+Always show this dialog+` option)
* This will take a few minutes, since you have to download and install all the needed packages. *Do not interrupt this*
====

The build pipeline goes like this:

----
asciidoc -> [asciidoctor] -> docbook -> [pandoc] -> latex -> [xelatex] -> pdf
----
