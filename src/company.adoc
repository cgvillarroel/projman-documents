=== Project: PubRAMS: A Project Document Publishing System

PubRAMS is a solution made for Asia Pacific College (APC) that aims to address the tedious and potentially confusing process of publishing student project documents to the school's library. This process involves the exchange of documents across multiple channels among staff from different offices. Associated processes also involve tedious encoding of numerous projects details for recording, publishing, and analyzing purposes. This solution aims to consolidate all these processes onto a single platform, automating processes and providing tools to simplify interactions.
