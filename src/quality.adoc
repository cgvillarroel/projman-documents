The project team will incorporate Agile methodologies in particular Scrum practices, including user stories, sprints, and retrospectives, to ensure that quality is built-in throughout the project's lifecycle and meets the organization's quality standards and the needs of the project stakeholders.

Overall, the Quality Management Approach for PubRAMS will prioritize delivering a high-quality product that would meet the customers’ requirements through Agile and Scrum methodologies. The approach is intended to be flexible and to be continuously refined to ensure that the project meets or exceeds the quality expectations of the stakeholders.

=== Quality Requirements / Standards

The development of PubRAMS puts great emphasis on quality by the team, which calls for implementation and monitoring of quality requirements and standards. Comments of stakeholders, conducting of tests, and product assessments will be used to ensure adherence to quality standards.

Product Quality requirements are as follows:

* PubRAMS must be complete and operational and adheres to the technical requirements of the product backlog.
* The interface must be user-friendly, easily accessible and have proper navigation.
* The implementation must be compatible with the school’s current technological infrastructure.
* Up-to-date security measures must be implemented to safeguard user privacy and security.

Ensuring Quality of Processes requires:

* The project manager and development team to review and approve all project deliverables prior to submission of product to stakeholders.
* The development team to implement a series of tests to assess quality assurance of the system with regards to its technical specifications and requirements.
* A version control tool to be utilized to ensure modifications to the system to be properly documented and reviewed with proper authorization.
* Regular sprint reviews to be conducted by the development team to identify and address any quality issues.
* The development team to create and follow a configuration management process to properly assess and ensure consistent development, testing, and deployment of the system.

For compliance demonstration:

* PubRAMS will undergo test and evaluation against established quality standards and requirements before deployment to the client.
* The development team will maintain comprehensive documentation of all testing and evaluation for quality assurance which will be made available to the client upon request.
* The development team will demonstrate the product to the client to ensure the system meets their requirements and expectations.

=== Quality Assurance

The Quality Assurance process for PubRAMS will be included in the Agile and Scrum methodologies to ensure quality through collaboration and continuous improvement. The following activities will be done:

. *Test Plan and Test Case Review*: Review all test plans and test cases created by the developers along with the stakeholders to ensure that the test plans adequately cover all functionalities and nonfunctional requirements of the system.
. *Test Monitoring and Analysis*: Actively monitor testing processes, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Analysis would identify trends, patterns, or recurring defects, enabling them to help pinpoint areas that require additional testing or to highlight potential systematic issues.
. *Defect Identification and Reporting*: Identified defects will be documented in defect reports, which includes:
+
** Description of the defect
** Steps to reproduce the defect
** Expected behavior vs. Actual behavior
** Severity level (critical, major, minor)
** Priority level (high, medium, low)

+
Clear documentation helps developers to prioritize and efficiently resolve defects.
. *Quality Control Procedure Audits*: Conduct periodic audits of the quality control procedures implemented throughout the project lifecycle. Audits will assess the effectiveness of testing activities, code reviews, and other control measures. As such is to identify potential weaknesses in the quality control process and suggest improvements for future iterations.
. *Quality Assurance Reports*: Prepare and maintain reports to summarize the activities, findings, and recommendations. Such reports may include:
+
** Test execution status and results
** Defect trends and analysis
** Audit findings and recommendations
** Overall quality risk assessment

+
Such reports keep stakeholders informed about the quality status of the project and are able to facilitate decision making.

The quality assurance metrics will be closely monitored, tracked, and reported regularly to ensure the quality of the product. Violations of these standards are to be reviewed and addressed.  The quality assurance procedure will also be reviewed frequently to possibly implement further improvements. PubRAMS must be ensured to meet the best of quality standards and for all quality assurance metrics to be closely monitored.

=== Quality Control

Quality Control is essential during the development process as it focuses on continuous testing and quality feedback. The process for PubRAMS will include the following:

. *Development Phase*: Developers will perform unit testing of their code to ensure it meets functional specifications.

Integration testing will also be performed to verify the functionality of the different system components working together.
. *System Testing Phase*: System integration testing will be conducted to ensure all system components function as a whole. Performance testing will be performed to measure system functionality and efficiency. Security testing will be conducted to identify vulnerabilities and ensure data security.
. *User Acceptance Testin (UAT)*: Developers and stakeholders will participate in UAT to verify that the system meets their requirements and expectations. A guideline will be developed to guide the users in testing specific functionalities. Usability testing will also be conducted to evaluate the ease of use and user experience of the system.

Quality Control of PubRAMS will be an integral part of the development process, focusing on continuous testing, user feedback, and performance monitoring. The team will monitor and assess the quality of the product as part of the Quality Control process, ensuring that it meets the quality requirements and standards of the stakeholders.

=== Quality Control Measurements

Quality Control Measurements will be made during the development process to guarantee that the product fulfills the standards and criteria. Agile Scrum methodologies are to be utilized to promote continuous inspection and modification throughout the lifecycle of the project, which will adopt a transparent and collaborative approach to quality control.

The following quality control measurements will be used to assess the effectiveness of the quality control processes:

. *Defect Tracking*: Defects identified during testing will be documented.
. *Defect Resolution Rate*: The percentage of defects resolved within a defined timeframe will be measured.
. *Test Coverage*: The percentage of system functionality covered by test cases will be tracked.
. *User Acceptance Testing Results*: The number of unresolved issues identified during UAT will be tracked.
