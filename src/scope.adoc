== Scope Management Plan

=== Introduction

The scope of work will be established, confirmed, monitored, and validated according to the guidelines in the scope management plan. The scope management plan’s goal is to guarantee that the project remains on track and achieves its intended scope within the established timetable and budget. To create the scope management plan for the PubRAM, the team will follow the five-step process of Project Scope Management: collecting requirements, defining scope, creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), verifying scope, and controlling scope.

==== Collect Requirements

To gather the necessary requirements for this project, we will conduct interviews with our stakeholders. This approach will help us understand their specific needs and preferences related to their roles in the project.

==== Define Scope

To define the project scope, user stories and the scope statement will be incorporated into a comprehensive project management plan. This plan will be continuously updated to reflect any changes to the project's scope as it evolves.

==== Create WBS

The project scope is divided into smaller, more manageable units using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This aids in enhancing the project team's capacity to efficiently manage the project by breaking down the scope into understandable components. The resultant WBS visually depicts the project's scope, rendering it more accessible to all team members.

==== Verify Scope

In this phase, project deliverables are thoroughly assessed and validated to ensure they align with the specifications outlined in the project scope statement. This process aids in maintaining the project's schedule and ensures that the deliverables fulfill stakeholders' requirements. To achieve this, our team will conduct a walkthrough of the project deliverables with the stakeholders. This will ensure that the deliverables align with their needs and expectations.

==== Control Scope
This phase involves overseeing and managing alterations to the project's scope. This includes managing modifications to the project's scope and addressing any instances of scope creep that may occur during project execution.

=== Scope Management Approach

. *Scope Authority and Responsibility* - The Project Manager, Jojo F. Castillo, holds the primary authority and responsibility for scope management, supported by guidance from the Project Sponsor, Manuel Sebastian S. Sanchez, to ensure the project is successfully executed within its defined scope and timeline.
. *Scope Definition* - To precisely define the project scope, SemiByte will utilize various documents, including but not limited to: the Scope Statement, Statement of Work (SOW), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, and other relevant materials. These documents collectively ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope, objectives, requirements, and deliverables.
. *Scope Measure and Verification* - To clearly establish the project's measurement and verification, the following metrics will be used:
** Success Criteria - These measures will evaluate compliance to the defined scope of work and measure overall project completion.
** Project Sponsor Approval - The project sponsor's crucial approval will verify that the project has adhered to its intended scope, as specified by their recommendations, approvals, and constraints.
. *Scope Change Process* - Jojo F. Castillo, the project manager, and all team members are authorized to adjust the project scope as needed. However, changes will only proceed after thorough assessment of potential impacts on schedule, budget, and other factors. Approval from project sponsor Manuel Sebastian S. Sanchez is required before implementing any modifications.
. *Acceptance of Final Project Deliverables* - The project sponsor, Manuel Sebastian S. Sanchez, must approve the final project deliverable and the project scope. Jojo F. Castillo, the project manager, will ensure that all deliverables align with the scope statement and that any changes are promptly communicated to the project sponsor. Close collaboration between the project manager and sponsor will ensure that all deliverables meet acceptance criteria and receive final approval.

=== Roles and Responsibilities

The following roles and responsibilities have been established in regard to managing the scope of the project:

* *Project Manager*: Is responsible for the overall management of the project and its scope.
* *Project Team*: Executes the project, verifying the feasibility of the established scope, and raises concerns that may require scope changes.
* *Key Stakeholders*: Provide input and approve changes.

=== Scope Definition

The scope of this project includes the development of a new platform that will consolidate and simplify the processes involved in project document publishing. This platform should compile all relevant projects and details into easily navigable views. It should also provide tools for tracking progress and automating tedious tasks such as encoding and data collection.

=== Project Scope Statement

This section details the work and deliverables that are and are not included within the scope of the project. 

==== Product Scope Description

The project involves the implementation of a new platform that will consolidate and simplify the processes involved in project document publishing. Each user will have all relevant projects compiled into a single view, and actionable items will be highlighted. The progress of every project will also be tracked and displayed, and once action is taken, the users of the following steps will be notified. Tools will also be provided to aid in the most tedious tasks, such as encoding data into Koha and gathering data.

==== Product Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered completed when the following criteria are met:

* All required features have been implemented and tested.
* The system has been successfully deployed and is accessible to APC students and staff.
* The key stakeholders verify that all established requirements have been met.

==== Project Deliverables

The following deliverables must be completed to deem the project complete:

* The project document publishing system as described by the requirements
* Technical documentation.
* User manuals and documentation.

==== Project Exclusions

The following are not included within the scope of the project:

* Features not listed within the project scope statement.
* Maintenance beyond the initial deployment after the project is deemed to be completed.

==== Project Constraints

Listed are the preliminary constraints for the proposed project:

* Available resources to support the development of the project.
* Available time of the developers of the project.

==== Project Assumptions

Listed are the preliminary assumptions for the proposed project:

•	The system will only be accessible by Asia Pacific College (APC) students and staff.
•	APC has the necessary resources to support the development, deployment, and maintenance of the system.
•	Where possible, the project will be able to take advantage of systems already currently being used by APC (namely Microsoft Entra ID for authentication, Microsoft SharePoint for file handling, and Koha for library publishing).

=== Work Breakdown Structure

The project will be broken down into five phases: initiation, planning, execution, control, closeout. Below is the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) tree view diagram, which serves as an overview.

=== Scope Verification

To verify that the scope of the project is maintained and adhered to, the team will be taking advantage of the following methods:
 
* *Quality Checklists*: The requirements of the system and expectations of the stakeholders will be compiled and maintained. These criteria will be used as a reference to ensure that the scope is adhered to.
* *Work Performance Measurements*: Various measurements and metrics will be used to monitor the progress of the deliverables and ensure that the project is adhering to the scope.
* *Scope Baseline*: The original scope of the project will be kept as a reference of the deviations and evolution of the scope throughout the development of the project.
* *Formal Acceptance*: Finally, to ensure that the project and its deliverables serve the needs and meet the expectations of the stakeholders, feedback and formal acceptance of the stakeholders will be sought.

=== Scope Control

Scope control will be included in the regular monitoring processes during the development of the project. Regular periodic reviews will be conducted throughout the project to assess many different aspects. Among these are the progress of the deliverables and any deviations observed. This will be conducted by the project manager. Should any modification to the project scope seem necessary, it must first be approved by the various roles involved in managing the scope:

. Any member or stakeholder may make a request to change the scope.
. The project manager and project sponsor will assess whether the change is necessary. The project sponsor takes precedence over the project manager.
. Should it be rejected, the current scope will be maintained.
. Should it be approved, the scope and documentation will be updated, and all involved will be notified.
