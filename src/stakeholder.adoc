== Stakeholder Management Strategy

=== Introduction

The purpose of the Stakeholder Management Strategy is to facilitate smooth and productive interactions with stakeholders throughout the project development process. Our approach is designed to ensure the success of our projects by understanding the needs of all stakeholders involved. This approach involves identifying, prioritizing, and analyzing the diverse needs and interests of our stakeholders.

=== Identify Stakeholders

To properly develop a stakeholder management strategy, it is important to first identify the stakeholders involved. The stakeholders of the project will be the prospective users who will derive value from the system. To do this, the various roles associated with the current processes will be analyzed. Potential new roles in the system will also be assessed. During this, each role's interest, priority, contribution, and resistance will be identified. These points will be used to guide the project, as well as identify key stakeholders that should have greater influence over the development of the project.

=== Key Stakeholders 

The project's success rests on the shoulders of its key stakeholders. These individuals are deeply impacted by, invested in, and hold the most influence over the project's outcome. By fostering strong engagement with these stakeholders, companies can make strategic decisions with confidence, minimize risks, and drive business growth. Identifying key stakeholders early is essential, as it allows us to tailor communication strategies and actively seek their input on desired involvement throughout the project lifecycle. This tailored approach ensures stakeholders receive communication and management aligned with their desired involvement.

The following roles represent key stakeholders in our project:

* PBL coordinator
* Executive Director
* Program Director
* Librarian

=== Stakeholder Analysis

The stakeholders of PubRAMS were identified by thoroughly examining the project submission management and proofreading system along with engaging with the staff directly involved in its operation. This analysis aims to assess the influence or power each stakeholder holds over the project.
