== Work Breakdown Structure

=== Introduction

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a fundamental project management tool that delineates the project's scope into manageable sections, enabling efficient planning, execution, and control. This document presents the WBS for PubRAMS, designed to provide a structured and hierarchical decomposition of the project deliverables and tasks. By breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable components, the WBS facilitates clear definition of work packages, assignment of responsibilities, and tracking of progress.

The Work Breakdown Structure presented here represents all the work required to complete this project.

=== Outline View

The outline view presents an easy to view and understand layout for the WBS.

=== Glossary of Terms

The Glossary of Terms will serve as a guide on terms mentioned within this document.

WBS Code.:: A unique identifier assigned to each element in a Work Breakdown Structure for the purpose of designating the element's hierarchical location within the WBS.
Work Package.:: A Work Package is a deliverable or work component at the lowest level of its WBS branch.
WBS Component.:: A component of a WBS which is located at any level.  It can be a Work Package or a WBS Element as there's no restriction on what a WBS Component is.
WBS Element.:: A WBS Element is a single WBS component, and its associated attributes located anywhere within a WBS.  A WBS Element can contain work, or it can contain other WBS Elements or Work Packages.
